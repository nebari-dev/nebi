Should nebi cli in different locations be expected to need to communicate directly with the same nebi server or should nebi be able to recognize pre-existing nebi compatible OCI repos?

e.g. I use nebi from Nebari and then I push to an OCI repo registry and then I'm at my home and do I need to have access to that same Nebi server or do I just need to have access to the OCI repo?

How would one use nebi locally on Nebari?
